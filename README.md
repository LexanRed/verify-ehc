Verify EHC
==========

A simple Python script to decode and verify an European Health Certificate QR-code.

Note that the expiration date read from the EHC doesn't seem to be the propper
expiration date of tests or vaccinations as defined by EU or local law. In all
examples I saw it is much longer. Therefore you need to implement your own logic
with the rules defined by your government to get propper expirations dates.

Here in Austria the rules as of writing (2021-06-26) are as follows (Source:
[gesundheit.gv.at](https://www.gesundheit.gv.at/service/gruener-pass/inhalt#heading_Was_bekomme_ich_ein_Impfzertifikat_und_wie_lange_gilt_es_)):

For tests:

* Self-Test: 24 hours (though as far as I know self-tests don't get an EHC)
* Antigen-Tests: 48 hours
* PCR-Tests: 72 hours

For vaccinations:

* For vaccines with 2 vacciantions:
  - 1st vaccination is valid starting from 22 days and ending at 90 days after
    the vaccination
  - 2nd vaccination adds 180 days to that (i.e. it's valid for 270 days from
    the 1st vaccination, though the date of the 1st vaccination is not included
    in the EHC of the 2nd vaccination!)
* For vaccines with only 1 vaccination (e.g. Johnson & Johnson):
  - valid starting from 22 days and ending at 270 days after the vaccination
* For people recovered from COVID-19 that only need 1 vaccination:
  - valid starting from the day of vaccination and ending at 270 days after

**NOTE:** These rules might be different in different countries and are subject
to change. This information is supplied without liability.

Norwegian COVID-19 Certificate
------------------------------

This script also tries to support Norwegian COVID-19 certificates, which seem
to be the same as European Health Certificates except with an `NO1:` prefix
instead of an `HC1:` prefix. Though this is untested for lack of real life
examples. See also
[this blog post](https://harrisonsand.com/posts/covid-certificates/).

Usage
-----

```plain
usage: verify_ehc.py [-h]
                     [--certs-file FILE | --certs-from LIST | --certs-table LIST]
                     [--no-verify] [--list-certs] [--print-exts]
                     [--strip-revoked] [--save-certs FILE]
                     [--allow-public-key-only] [--image]
                     [ehc_code ...]

positional arguments:
  ehc_code              Scanned EHC QR-code, or when --image is passed path to
                        an image file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --certs-file FILE     Trust list in CBOR or JSON format.
  --certs-from LIST     Download trust list from given country's trust list
                        service. Comma separated list, entries from later
                        country overwrites earlier.
                        
                        Supported countries: AT, CH, DE, FR, NL, NO, SE, UK
                        
                        CH needs the environment variable CH_TOKEN set to a
                        bearer token that can be found in the BIT's Android
                        CovidCertificate app APK. See also:
                        https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ch-dcc-keys
                        
                        FR needs the environment variable FR_TOKEN set to a
                        bearer token that can be found in the TousAntiCovid
                        Verif app APK.
                        
                        NO needs the environment variable NO_TOKEN set to a
                        AuthorizationHeader string that can be found in the
                        Kontroll av koronasertifikat app APK. See also:
                        https://harrisonsand.com/posts/covid-certificates/
                        
                        Note that the UK trust list only contains UK public
                        keys, so you might want to combine it with another.
                        
                        If neither --certs-file nor --certs-from is given then
                        --certs-from=DE,AT is used as default.
                        
  --certs-table LIST    Print table of trust list certificates showing where
                        which key ID is avaliable showing the country of the
                        certificate as it is known to the given trust list. "X"
                        means the certificate/public key is in the trust list,
                        but no country attribute is known for it.
  --no-verify           Skip certificate verification.
  --list-certs          List certificates from trust list.
  --print-exts          Also print certificate extensions.
  --strip-revoked       Strip revoked certificates. (Downloads certificate
                        revocation list, if supported by certificate.)
  --save-certs FILE     Store downloaded trust list to FILE. The filetype is
                        derived from the extension, which can be .json or .cbor
  --allow-public-key-only, --allow-pubkey-only
                        When writing the CBOR trust list format it usually
                        rejects entries that are only public keys and not full
                        x509 certificates. With this options it also writes
                        entries that are only public keys.
  --image               ehc_code is a path to an image file containing a
                        QR-code.
```

You can also use this tool to download the trust list as provided of one (or
more) of the supported countries and save it as JSON or CBOR:

```bash
./verify_ehc.py --certs-from AT --save-certs austrian_trust_list.json
```

```bash
./verify_ehc.py --certs-from AT --save-certs austrian_trust_list.cbor
```

It is also possible to save both versions at once:

```bash
./verify_ehc.py --certs-from AT \
    --save-certs austrian_trust_list.cbor \
    --save-certs austrian_trust_list.json
```

The CBOR version is in the same format as the CBOR part of the Austrian trust
list. The JSON version is in a format that is useful when used with the
WebCrypto browser API. I.e. it supplies the public keys as JSON Web Keys (JWK)
and the algorithm parameter object as needed by the WebCrypto API.

**NOTE:** Some trust list endpoints (UK, FR, NL) return only public keys instead
of full x509 certificates for some or all entries. These are supported for EHC
verification (untested because of lack of examples), but because they're no real
x509 certificates a valid time range of `1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00` to
`9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999+00:00` is used. When using `--save-certs` with a
CBOR file these public keys are skipped and an error message is printed for
each. You can use them when saving the trust list to JSON, though, because that
itself doesn't contain a full x509 certificate.
